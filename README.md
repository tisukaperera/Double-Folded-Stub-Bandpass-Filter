The following is a report detailing the simulation, prototyping, and measuring of a double folded bandpass filtering device, I completed for my Devices and Antenna's course.\
The simulations were completed using AWR Design Environment.
The prototype was constructed using a soldering iron, and was tested using VNA 2-port measurement device.
